# Calc-Source
This is a caluclator I made using Love2D in 2 days but I continued development on it.

The calculator can be used fully with a mouse (except delete), but partially with a keyboard because I can't figure out how to make "+" work

It is a very simple calculator
##### Now With Keypad Support

My code commenting skills aren't hat good

Enjoy :)
